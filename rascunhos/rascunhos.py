Git (/ɡɪt/)[7] is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files, originally designed
for coordinating work among programmers cooperating on source code during software development.[8] Its goals include
speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on
different systems).[9][10][11] Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with
other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[12] Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core
maintainer. As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git
directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities,
independent of network access or a central server.[13] Git is free and open-source software distributed under GNU
General Public License Version 2.
